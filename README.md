 Welcome to my real world NFT project, called biKA Punks- biKAP, where you can create, and mint your own unique NFT collectibles from scratch.
 
 This is a generative art collection, each have different properties, mixed and matched to generate the NFT.

 You'll not see which NFT you want to mint, it will only appear after the minting process has been approved inside Metamask wallet. So it's like a surprise NFT drop.

 The project is currently deployed to Sepolia TestNet

 This token and smart-contract has been created as per ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token standard, used OpenZeppelin library and tests developed as per Hardhat specifics.

 The images are stored on Pinata and handled using the I.P.F.S protocol.

 Front-End created with React.js and website deployed to Fleek.


 Token name: "Bika Punks"

 Token symbol: "biKAP"

 Max supply: 25 

 Token contract address: '0x1b9456B10178d408A59254739132093B48f66512'

 # How to interact with the project:
1. Go to [(https://muddy-band-2244.on.fleek.co/)].
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Sign in to the contract.
4. Select Sepolia TESTNET.
5. You'll need SepoliaETH to interact with the Mint contract, go to Sepolia Faucet and request some tokens:  [(https://sepoliafaucet.com/)], copy your account public key and paste it in.(It might take few minutes for the SepoliaETH to reach your account).
6. Click MINT, approve using your wallet, and behind the scenes your unique NFT will be created and the smart-contract than will spit out your NFT.
7. You'll see the page refresh's and the NFT preview page changes to your uniquely minted NFT.
8. Repeat the process to see all 25 unique NFT's.(Make sure to have SepoliaETH tho...).

 
Thank you. Hope you enjoyed it.
